# AITAndroidChess
This is a simple chess board analyzer that allows the user to freely set up a board as opposed to progressing through the game step by step like most other chess assistants.
It evaluates relative danger level of each piece to help you catch dangerous positions you might miss

The app will allow the user to arrange a chess board to the configuration of their choosing and will 
highlight all squares that the opponent can attack, and highlight in a different color all pieces of the 
player that can be taken by the opponent. The user would be able to clear and reset the board or save 
the board to go back to later.
